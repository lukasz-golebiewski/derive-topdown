======

derive-topdown-0.0.0.7
--------------
- `0.0.0.7` is a more carefully implemented version of derive-topdown.
All APIs are **totally** changed compared with 0.0.0.2. Originally it did not work with types that contain type synonyms and polymorphic types. It can work for most common cases in this version now.

derive-topdown-0.0.0.2
--------------
- Fixed some cabal file and API problems.

derive-topdown-0.0.0.1
--------------
- This is only an experimental implementation for deriving class instances from top to bottom.
There is a lot of deficiencies.
